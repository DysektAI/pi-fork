# Development Rules

## Conversational Style

- Keep answers short and concise
- No emojis in commits, issues, PR comments, or code
- No fluff or cheerful filler text (e.g., "Thanks @user" not "Thanks so much @user!")
- Technical prose only, be direct
- When the user asks a question, answer it first before making edits or running implementation commands.
- When responding to user feedback or an analysis, explicitly say whether you agree or disagree before saying what you changed.

## Fork Architecture and Updates

This repository has one authoritative downstream release model. Do not reopen or replace it unless the user explicitly asks for a redesign:

- `upstream/main` is the canonical upstream history. `main` is an exact mirror pointer for it and must not contain DysektAI changes.
- `local` is the single long-lived DysektAI branch: upstream history plus fork commits. Fork source releases and `+local.N` tags are built only from `local`.
- `fork-sync.sh` is a maintainer operation. It advances the `main` mirror from `upstream/main`, merges that mirror into `local`, validates both refs, and atomically publishes `main` and `local`. It is not the end-user self-update command.
- A source installation is recognized only from a checkout containing `.git`, `.fork/local-version`, and the expected `packages/coding-agent/package.json`. Its automatic version check queries only the latest `DysektAI/pi-fork` GitHub release. It must never fall back to the upstream package feed.
- For a verified source checkout, `pi update --self` fetches `origin/local`, switches to `local`, fast-forwards to `origin/local` (failing safely if `local` has diverged), runs `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, and rebuilds. It does not merge `upstream/main`, run `fork-sync.sh`, install the repository root through npm, or require a release tarball asset.
- npm/pnpm/yarn/Bun installations are upstream package installations, not fork source checkouts. They remain on the published upstream package update channel.
- If asked how fork updates work, state this model directly. Do not propose installing `github:DysektAI/pi-fork`, adding a release `.tgz`, or replacing self-update with a `fork-sync.sh` instruction unless the user asks to change the established model.

See [FORK.md](FORK.md) for the operational guide.

## Upstream Contributions

Fork patches that belong upstream are proposed, not merged locally and forgotten. The rules below are settled; do not relitigate them per branch:

- Branch from `main` (the upstream mirror), never from `local`. `local` trails `upstream/main`, so branching from it silently reverts upstream commits in every file you touch. Verify with `git rev-list --count $(git merge-base main <branch>)..main`, which must be `0`.
- An upstream-facing branch carries **no** `CHANGELOG.md` edit. Upstream's `CONTRIBUTING.md` reserves changelog entries for maintainers. The fork's changelog rules below apply only to commits destined for `local`.
- Keep one focused commit per proposal where practical, and run `npm run check` plus the affected tests before pushing.
- Draft the proposal as an issue on `DysektAI/pi-fork` first, using the upstream issue template shape. Rewrite it in your own voice before moving it upstream: upstream auto-closes new-contributor issues, requires "your own voice" prose, caps issues at one screen, and blocks accounts that submit agent-generated slop.
- Do not open an upstream PR until a maintainer replies `lgtm` in the documented command position. `lgtmi` clears issues only.
- `.fork/rr-cache` is tracked only on `feat/fork-tooling`; `setup-fork.sh` restores it from `feat/fork-tooling` or `origin/feat/fork-tooling`. Never re-add it to `local`.

## Code Quality

- Read files in full before wide-ranging changes, before editing files you have not fully inspected, and when asked to investigate or audit. Do not rely on search snippets for broad changes.
- No `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Inline single-line helpers that have only one call site.
- Check node_modules for external API types; don't guess.
- **No inline imports** (`await import()`, `import("pkg").Type`, dynamic type imports). Top-level imports only.
- Never remove or downgrade code to fix type errors from outdated deps; upgrade the dep instead.
- Use only erasable TypeScript syntax (Node strip-only mode) in code checked by the root config (`packages/*/src`, `packages/*/test`, `packages/coding-agent/examples`): no parameter properties, `enum`, `namespace`/`module`, `import =`, `export =`, or other constructs needing JS emit. Use explicit fields with constructor assignments.
- Always ask before removing functionality or code that appears intentional.
- Do not preserve backward compatibility unless the user asks for it.
- Never hardcode key checks (e.g. `matchesKey(keyData, "ctrl+x")`). Add defaults to `DEFAULT_EDITOR_KEYBINDINGS` or `DEFAULT_APP_KEYBINDINGS` so they stay configurable.
- Never modify `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` directly; update `packages/ai/scripts/generate-models.ts` instead, then regenerate. Including the resulting `models.generated.ts` diff is always OK, even if regeneration includes unrelated upstream model metadata changes.

## Commands

- After code changes (not docs): `npm run check` (full output, no tail). Fix all errors, warnings, and infos before committing. Does not run tests.
- Never run `npm run build` or `npm test` unless requested by the user.
- Never run the full vitest suite directly: it includes e2e tests that activate when endpoint/auth env vars are present. For all non-e2e tests, run `./test.sh` from the repo root. Otherwise run specific tests from the package root: `node ../../node_modules/vitest/dist/cli.js --run test/specific.test.ts`.
- If you create or modify a test file, run it and iterate on test or implementation until it passes.
- For `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/`, use `test/suite/harness.ts` + the faux provider. No real provider APIs, keys, or paid tokens.
- Put issue-specific regressions under `packages/coding-agent/test/suite/regressions/` named `<issue-number>-<short-slug>.test.ts`.
- For ad-hoc scripts, `write` them to a temp file (e.g. `/tmp`), run, edit if needed, remove when done. Don't embed multi-line scripts in `bash` commands.
- Never commit unless the user asks.

## Dependency and Install Security

- Treat npm dep and lockfile changes as reviewed code. Direct external deps stay pinned to exact versions.
- Hydrate/update locally with `npm install --ignore-scripts`; clean/CI-style with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. Don't run lifecycle scripts unless the user asks.
- If dep metadata changes, refresh `package-lock.json` with `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`.
- If `packages/coding-agent/npm-shrinkwrap.json` needs regen, run `node scripts/generate-coding-agent-shrinkwrap.mjs` (verify with `--check` or `npm run check`). New deps with lifecycle scripts require review and an explicit allowlist entry in that script; never add one silently.
- Pre-commit blocks lockfile commits unless `PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1`. Don't bypass unless the user wants the lockfile change committed.

## Git

Multiple pi sessions may be running in this cwd at the same time, each modifying different files. Git operations that touch unstaged, staged, or untracked files outside your own changes will stomp on other sessions' work. Follow these rules:

Committing:

- Only commit files YOU changed in THIS session.
- Stage explicit paths (`git add <path1> <path2>`); never `git add -A` / `git add .`.
- Before committing, run `git status` and verify you are only staging your files.
- `packages/ai/src/models.generated.ts` may always be included alongside your files.
- Message format: `{feat,fix,docs}[(ai,tui,agent,coding-agent)]: <commit message> (optionally multiple lines)`. Message is informative and concise.

Never run (destroys other agents' work or bypasses checks):

- `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit --no-verify`.

If rebase conflicts occur:

- Resolve conflicts only in files you modified.
- If a conflict is in a file you did not modify, abort and ask the user.
- Never force push.

## Issues and PRs

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the contributor gate (auto-close workflows, `lgtm`/`lgtmi`, quality bar).

When reviewing PRs:

- Do not run `gh pr checkout`, `git switch`, or otherwise move the worktree to the PR branch unless the user explicitly asks.
- Use `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, `gh api`, and local `git show`/`git diff` against fetched refs to inspect PR metadata, commits, and patches without changing branches.
- If you need PR file contents, fetch/read them into temporary files or use `git show <ref>:<path>` without switching branches.

Before merging a PR, all of the following are mandatory merge gates:

1. Fetch every review and review comment with pagination. Sort reviews by `submittedAt`; never assume the REST response order or use `reviews[0]` as the latest review.
2. Query `pullRequest.reviewThreads` through GitHub GraphQL, paginate until `hasNextPage` is false, and inspect `isResolved`, `isOutdated`, and every comment in each thread. The REST review-comments endpoint does not expose thread resolution and must not be used to infer it.
3. For every non-outdated thread: validate the finding, implement and test valid findings, and reply with a technical rationale for invalid findings. Mark a thread resolved only after its fix is pushed or its rationale is posted to the PR.
4. Re-fetch reviews and threads after every head update and wait for in-progress reviewers to finish. A summary containing `issues found` or any non-outdated unresolved thread is a merge blocker. Automated findings are not optional merely because their check reports success or their review state is `COMMENTED`.
5. Require all required checks to pass on the exact current PR head SHA. A successful run on an ancestor does not count; `[skip ci]` on the latest commit does not waive this gate.
6. Immediately before merge, record the head SHA, total/resolved/unresolved thread counts, latest review summaries, and checks attached to that SHA. The invariant is zero non-outdated unresolved threads and zero unaddressed review findings. If this cannot be proven, do not merge.
7. After merge, verify the resulting commit contains the reviewed changes. When GitHub creates a merge commit, also verify that it has the reviewed head SHA as a parent. Do not create a release until the merge and release checks succeed.

When creating issues:

- Add `pkg:*` labels for affected packages (`pkg:agent`, `pkg:ai`, `pkg:coding-agent`, `pkg:tui`); use all that apply.

When posting issue/PR comments:

- Write the comment to a temp file and post with `gh issue/pr comment --body-file` (never multi-line markdown via `--body`).
- Keep comments concise, technical, in the user's tone.
- End every AI-posted comment with the AI-generated disclaimer line specified by the originating prompt (e.g. `This comment is AI-generated by `/wr``).

When closing issues via commit:

- Include `fixes #<number>` or `closes #<number>` in the message so merging auto-closes the issue. For multiple issues, repeat the keyword per issue (`closes #1, closes #2`); a shared keyword (`closes #1, #2`) only closes the first.

## Testing pi Interactive Mode with tmux

Run the TUI in a controlled terminal (from the repo root):

```bash
tmux new-session -d -s pi-test -x 80 -y 24
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "./pi-test.sh" Enter
sleep 3 && tmux capture-pane -t pi-test -p     # capture after startup
tmux send-keys -t pi-test "your prompt here" Enter
tmux send-keys -t pi-test Escape               # special keys (also C-o for ctrl+o, etc.)
tmux kill-session -t pi-test
```

## Changelog

Location: `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` (one per package).

Sections under `## [Unreleased]`: `### Breaking Changes` (API changes requiring migration), `### Added`, `### Changed`, `### Fixed`, `### Removed`.

Rules:

- All new entries go under `## [Unreleased]`. Read the full section first and append to existing subsections; never duplicate them.
- Released version sections (e.g. `## [0.12.2]`) are immutable; never modify them.

Attribution:

- Internal (from issues): `Fixed foo bar ([#123](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/issues/123))`
- External contributions: `Added feature X ([#456](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/pull/456) by [@username](https://github.com/username))`

## Releasing

**Lockstep versioning**: all packages share one version; every release updates all together. `patch` = fixes + additions, `minor` = breaking changes. No major releases.

1. **Update CHANGELOGs**: ask the user whether they ran the `/cl` prompt on the latest commit on `main`. If not, they must run `/cl` first to audit and update each package's `[Unreleased]` section before releasing.

2. **Local smoke test**: build an unpublished release and smoke test from outside the repo (so it can't resolve workspace files):
   ```bash
   npm run release:local -- --out /tmp/pi-local-release --force
   cd /tmp

   # Node package install smoke tests
   /tmp/pi-local-release/node/pi --help
   /tmp/pi-local-release/node/pi --version
   /tmp/pi-local-release/node/pi --list-models
   /tmp/pi-local-release/node/pi -p "Say exactly: ok"
   /tmp/pi-local-release/node/pi

   # Bun binary smoke tests
   /tmp/pi-local-release/bun/pi --help
   /tmp/pi-local-release/bun/pi --version
   /tmp/pi-local-release/bun/pi --list-models
   /tmp/pi-local-release/bun/pi -p "Say exactly: ok"
   /tmp/pi-local-release/bun/pi
   ```
   Verify both Node and Bun startup, model/account listing, interactive startup, and at least one real prompt with the intended default provider. The bare commands `/tmp/pi-local-release/node/pi` and `/tmp/pi-local-release/bun/pi` start interactive mode; run each in tmux, submit a prompt, and wait for the model reply before considering the interactive smoke test passed. Failures are release blockers unless the user explicitly accepts the risk.

3. **Run the release script**:
   ```bash
   PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1 npm_config_min_release_age=0 npm run release:patch    # fixes + additions
   PI_ALLOW_LOCKFILE_CHANGE=1 npm_config_min_release_age=0 npm run release:minor    # breaking changes
   ```
   Use `npm_config_min_release_age=0` only for the release command. The repo's normal npm age gate can otherwise block the release lockfile refresh when the current workspace package version was published recently. Review any lockfile or shrinkwrap diffs the release creates before push.

   The release script bumps all package versions, updates changelogs, regenerates release artifacts, runs `npm run check`, commits `Release vX.Y.Z`, tags `vX.Y.Z`, adds fresh `## [Unreleased]` changelog sections, commits `Add [Unreleased] section for next cycle`, then pushes `main` and the tag. Do not rerun the release script after a tag was pushed.

4. **CI publishes npm packages**: pushing the `vX.Y.Z` tag triggers `.github/workflows/build-binaries.yml`. The `publish-npm` job uses npm trusted publishing through GitHub Actions OIDC with environment `npm-publish`; no local `npm publish`, `npm whoami`, OTP, or WebAuthn flow is required.

5. **If CI publish fails**: inspect the failed `publish-npm` job. The publish helper is idempotent and skips package versions already present on npm, so rerun the tag workflow after fixing CI or transient npm issues. Do not rerun `npm run release:patch` or `npm run release:minor` for the same version.

## User Override

If the user's instructions conflict with any rule in this document, ask for explicit confirmation before overriding. Only then execute their instructions.
